# landing-page

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum, which teaches you about
web development. The goal of this project is to create a landing page using the html and css concepts that were learned so far. There were two images provided for the project: one displaying a sample landing page which is to be recreated, and the other being an image of fonts/colors that should be used with respect to each of the sections of the landing page. Accordingly, the landing page that is created is the final version of this project. It's also important to note that all the details displayed in the landing page are not real and are used for the purposes of completing this project. It's also important to say that the images used for this project are not mine. The image used in the header (webdev.png) was done by Markus Spiske and the image can be found in this link: https://www.pexels.com/photo/green-and-yellow-printed-textile-330771/. The image (websitemaking.png), under which the caption is "Customized websites for any and all purposes," is done by Antonio Batinic. This image can be found through this link: https://www.pexels.com/photo/black-screen-with-code-4164418/. The image (appmaking.png), under which the caption is "Creative and responsive desktop and phone apps for our clients," is done by Cottonbro Studio.

Moreover, after completing this project thoroughly, I learned how to properly use flexbox properties to design a fully responsive landing page and how to use specific fonts and colors in combination with html elements to emphasize certain parts of the landing page. The completion of this project also showed me a better way of making websites. I should first finish all the html parts of the website and then use flexbox to organize these parts into proper sections. As for the content of the website, when I am doing the html portions, I should use filler content. That is to say, only when I finish the styling with css should I go back to the filler content and replace them with the specifics. The specifics are referring to the reason as to why I am creating the website. Accordingly, this process that I learned by completing this project allowed me to formulate a structure on how I should go about creating websites. This was especially helpful because now I know what to focus on and when in relation to making websites.
